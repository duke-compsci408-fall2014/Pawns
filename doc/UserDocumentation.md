## Frequently Asked Questions

### Passes and Membership:

#### Should I get BayAreaChess Basic Membership?

The Basic Membership is beneficial to players who register for multiple events at a same time or play up. The cost of the basic membership Is $60 per year.
The membership gives you 25% discount of entry fees and play-up fees. The play-up fee information can be found here.

#### Should I get BayAreaChess Gold Pass (formerly Annual Pass)?

The Gold Pass is a $480 to $720 value as it allows you to play in up to $720 of tournaments without cash prizes or $480 per year of tournaments with cash prizes. The cost of the BayAreaChess Gold Pass is $365 for thirteen months. You may renew your gold (annual) pass if it runs out in the first year. Please note that you can't double dip by using both economy option and gold (annual) pass for the same entry. You must choose one discount. There is no limit on how much you spend each month and the pass for is valid for any tournament that Bay Area Chess organizes for running 12 months from the date of purchase. If you play in at least one BayAreaChess tournament or more every month, the Gold Pass pays off. 
Note 1: Change from $540 to $480 effective January 1, 2012. 
Note 2: No further discounts may be combined with this substantial discount. 
Note 3: Play-up fee is discounted but not eliminated for Gold Pass members.

#### I have already paid for tournaments this year. Can I get a credit for them same when I purchase the Gold Pass?

You can get credit for any tournament if you buy the pass on the same day. However, the pass gives a huge discount based on future commitment and can not factor in the past.

#### Why have you changed the rules for the Gold Pass (formerly Annual Pass)?

When we started the Gold pass, we were running quads and each section of Swiss generally once a month and by nature the tournament attendance was restructed to one location once a month. Lately, we have started running more tournaments and at different places. This includes additional tournaments are placed to fill voids in the CalChess calendar, quads in the Peninsula, and coming soon Swiss in the Peninsula. More options means more convenience for you and others. I believe the change is a good change and gives people more options. Now, if you are out for the summer or winter, you can use continue to register for each month and play twice as many tournaments when you are back. Or, if you have to miss one tournament, you can register for another.
The Gold Pass is a better value since you may decide that your kids prefer Quads or prefer Swiss and register them accordingly. Overall, the changes have been good and will get even better. We are already running tournaments 1-2 times a month and soon it will be 2-3 times. If we were to keep unlimited entries, we won't be able to offer more options and still be able to keep up with all the expenses in a tough economy with fewer entries in every tournament. I hope you will understand that you are part of the BayAreaChess community and if you have a better solution, I am willing to discuss it. This is a "labor of love" and giving the best facilities and experience for least expense.

#### Where can I find the CalChess Membership list?

A copy is available at http://www.bayareachess.com/about/calchess.php. However, please go towww.calchess.org for the latest updates.

Number of tournaments | Regular Discount
----------------------|------------------
2 | $5
3 | $10
4 | $20
5 | $30
6 | $40
7 | $50
8 | $60
9 | $70

### Awards:

#### What are the prizes for the tournaments (Swiss, Quads)?

In general, the Swiss, Quads (rated & unrated), and other tournaments for u1400 players everyone with a winning record (more wins than losses) is awarded a trophy. This emphasizes our philosophy that the true competition is with yourself.
However, we do recognize different levels of achievement. In the Swiss tournament, the top five players in each section get special trophies (if they have a winning record) and in the Quads (4-player round-robin), the winner gets a taller trophy than others. Sometimes the quads results produce 75% of the players getting a trophy.

#### I understand that the Quad and the Swiss have winners trophy but the super swiss category has only cash prizes (no trophies).. Is that correct?

Yes that is correct. Super Swiss is for more advanced players, generally USCF rating of over 1200. The entry fee for these events is also higher.

### Refunds:

#### What is BayAreaChess's refund and credit policy?

If you are part of myBayAreaChess community, credit/refund is usually not be a problem. Usually, if your plans change for any reason and you inform us at least 24 hours ahead of time, we credit 90% of the fees (deducting 10% for extra administrative work and bank charges). 
We don't advertise it much because we don't want people to register to "hold a place" if they are not serious. 
In cases of emergency, we can relax the 24 hours requirement. However, you must tell us at the earliest reasonable time before the tournament. 
We staff and rent facilities for after school programs based on enrollment so the refund and pro-rated fee structure varies and can be usually on the enrollment form. 
Note: Some of the National, State, and Special events have a $20 refund fee (or no refund after a certain date).
Apology: We regret having this policy but it is necessary because when we did not have that we used to get too many late changes requests. That made it difficult to estimate attendance for planning and distracted staff from organizing the details.
We will move the unplayed event to a different date, provided that we are given at least a 12 hours notice. So please plan well. Or you could register for one event only, and register and pay later onsite if your sons decide to play Quads as well.
