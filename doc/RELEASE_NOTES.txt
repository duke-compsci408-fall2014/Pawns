As it stands this project is close to full basic functionality. It implements the following features:

	- Login portal
	- About page
	- Tournaments page 
	- Payment portal via PayPal 

However within the scope of this project the tournaments page does not pull all of the tournaments that it must from the database. This bug is currently being worked out however as it stands this is still a problem in the app. 

As for the actual functionality of the app, its been tested on several emulated devices such as the iPhone 5, 5s, 6, and 6+.
